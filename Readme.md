# Sass Tutorial - CSS With Superpowers

In this course, you will learn the basics of Sass. We will start with a brief overview of what Sass is along with what is required to incorporate Sass into your environment. We will also set up a Sass compiler in Visual Studio Code. You will learn about Sass variables, maps, nesting, functions, mixins, extending, and operations.

Lastly, we will start from scratch on a real-world project (Portfolio website) using Sass. We will go step-by-step through each part, and at the end, we will deploy the site.
